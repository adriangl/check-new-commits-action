# Check new commits action

This action checks if new commits have been added to a branch in an specified time interval by checking the commits added using the GitHub REST API.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Check for new commits today
  id: check-new-commits
  uses: adriangl/check-new-commits-action@v1
  with:
    token: 'your_github_token'
    seconds: 86400 # One day in seconds
    branch: 'master'
- name: Print something if new commits are found
  if: ${{ steps.check-new-commits.outputs.has-new-commits == 'true' }}
  run: echo "You have ${{ steps.check-new-commits.outputs.new-commits-number }} new commit(s) âœ…!"
- name: Print another thing if new commits couldn't be found
  if: ${{ steps.check-new-commits.outputs.has-new-commits != 'true' }}
  run: echo "You don't have new commits ðŸ›‘!"
```

## Inputs
These are all the possible inputs that the action works with:

Attribute                     | Description
------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
```token```                   | Access token used to access the GitHub API. You can either use the default
```seconds```                 | (Optional) The seconds interval that the action will use to check if there have been new commits.
```branch```                  | (Optional) The branch to check for new commits. When checking out the repository that triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that event. Otherwise, uses the default branch.

## Outputs
The action will dump data about the commits found in some output variables, which are:

Attribute                     | Description
------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
```has-new-commits```         | Whether or not new commits have been found for the required time interval as a boolean value (true or false).
```new-commits-number```      | The number of new commits found for the given interval. It will be 0 if no new commits could be found.

## Development
### Installing the required tools
* Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

* Set-up `nvm` with:
```shell
nvm install
```

* Install the dependencies with `npm`:
```shell
npm install
```
### Daily development workflow
* Start your terminal session with:
```shell
nvm use
```

* Check packages to upgrade with:
```shell
npx ncu
```

* Update packages with:
```shell
npm update
```

* When you add new features, build the TypeScript code:
```bash
npm run build
```

* And then, run the unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Testing the action locally
* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
* Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
* Create a `.secrets` file in the root of the project with the following:
```shell
GITHUB_TOKEN="a GitHub token with repo access"
```
* Create an `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
```shell
ACT=true # Should be set by act automatically
```
* Run the test action with:
```shell
npm run act
```

## Publishing
### Package and test all the code
* Run all checks in the project and package it:
```shell
npm run all
```
### Versioning
* Use `standard-version` to generate releases and changelogs for the new version from conventional commits syntax:
```shell
npm run release
```
* The script handles generating tags for the current release and for the current major release, as specified in the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md).
